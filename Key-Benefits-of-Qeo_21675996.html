                    <h4 id="KeyBenefitsofQeo-Cross-PlatformStandard">Cross-Platform Standard</h4><p>Currently, many home automation and Internet of Things solutions rely on platform-related and vendor-related solutions, making integration a painful if not impossible affair. Qeo provides cross-platform standardization, allowing it to be deployed on any device and any operation system.</p><h4 id="KeyBenefitsofQeo-DistributedSolution">Distributed Solution</h4><p>Qeo offers a distributed solution with minimal reliance on a central server. Once your devices are set up and authenticated, they can function independently from the Management Server.</p><h4 id="KeyBenefitsofQeo-WorksOutsidetheConstraintsoftheHome">Works Outside the Constraints of the Home</h4><p>Qeo is not limited to functioning within the home LAN, but functions anywhere in thanks to the Qeo Forwarder which ensures Qeo operation as long as an Internet connection is available.</p><h4 id="KeyBenefitsofQeo-EasySet-UpandHighTransparency">Easy Set-Up and High Transparency</h4><p>Qeo is easy to set up and integrates seamlessly with most development environments. It supports a range of common programming languages and platforms. Thanks to its transparent design, applications can be developed on a fairly high level, without the need to know or understand the inner workings. </p><h4 id="KeyBenefitsofQeo-Re-UseandStandardizationofComponents">Re-Use and Standardization of Components</h4><p>Qeo is set up in such a way that components can be easily re-used. For example, data structures developed in the <a class="unresolved" href="#">Qeo Data Model (QDM) </a>can be translated into components for different programming languages and components using the <a class="unresolved" href="#">Code Generator</a>. Data types can be standardized and re-used to ensure inter-operability of applications by different developers.</p><p> </p>
