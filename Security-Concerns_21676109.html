These certificates are dispensed by the Security Management Server when a device is added to a Qeo Realm. This means that the first time you run a Qeo application on a device, your device needs to be connected to the Internet to successfully add that device to a Realm and get a certificate.</p><p>When you want to test your application for the first time, you need to be connected to the Internet. At that time, the Qeo Service will try to make contact with the Security Management Server to get a certificate. Once authenticated, you can talk Qeo without an Internet connection.</p><h4 id="SecurityConcerns-PolicyFiles">Policy Files</h4><p>When creating a user, you also need to define a security policy associated with this user. This policy determines which Topics your user's devices will be able to access. We recommend leaving the default policy rules (read and write access to all Topics) during the development and testing of your applications. Unintended policy restrictions can lead to unexpected application behavior: the application will run normally, but will not be able to send or receive any relevant information.</p>
